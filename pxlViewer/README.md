A PyQt and WebView based image viewer.

*(Work in progress)*


I was getting a little annoyed at the default options in linux without needing to open GIMP or ImageMagic; so I made this.

______________________________

I've linked it to an alias for ease of use; in my *.bash_aliases* file I added-

*alias v='python /your/path/to/pxlViewer/viewer.py '*

and I'd run the script like this-

*v imageFile.jpg*
